# Fabric Tutorial Mod 1.21.8

## This mod *will* contain:
> An item or two
> Hopefully a **crafting recipe**
> Maybe a new **mechanic**

This is my first mod, so i'm not sure how much it will bring to a survival experience, but i will try!

Just learning Github as well, and also Markdown!

A lot of code in this repo will be taken from [this tutorial.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU8-qV-ZtUY)

Will add more if the time comes.
